			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is profit from flips driven more by renovation or market timing?
					<ul>
						In the MAPC report, "Homes for Profit," MAPC finds that investor flips resell for signficantly more than
						non investors. Oftentimes, flips are framed as just "greedy profits." Thus, I'm curious as to how much of the 
						resale premium comes from neighborhood wide price movement (market timing/greedy profit) in comparison to property
						specific value addition (renovation).
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How has corporate ownership growth accelerated after major economic shocks, for example such as 2008 and 2020?
					<ul>
						The ProPublica article, "When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord," mentions how private equity expanded aggressively
						after the Great Recession, taking advantage of crisis for the common people as an opportunity to acquire assets. However,
						I'm very curious of the extent to which corporations acquire after economic crisis compared to regular homeowners. This is 
						because anecdotally, my single mother was actually only able to afford our home after the 2008 economic crisis. Thus, I'm wondering
						how much my personal experience diverges from the average.
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Do corporations purchase homes in neighborhoods before major price appreciation or after?
					<ul>
						Both the MAPC and ProPublica articles describe corporate investors as active actors looking to seek high returns rather than
						passive participants that respond to price increases. In other words, if corporations purchase homes before major price appreciation,
						this implies forward looking speculation. Otherwise, corporations may just be following the market. Thus, this question targets
						whether speculation is directly shaping the market or just simply responding to it.
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li> Is there a threshold level of corporate ownership after which, owner occupancy rates in a neighborhood fail to recover?
					<ul>
						With this question, I more so want to investigate the very long term effects of speculation on neighborhoods. While the articles show the current
						data trends, I'm curious about the current overall effect thus far. I want to see whether neighborhoods seem to permanently shift to rental structures
						comapred to ownership.
					</ul>
				</li>
